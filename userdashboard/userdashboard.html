			<!-- Project Description -->
		<p>A membership-based grocery store initiative located in Hawthorn. This establishment is committed to providing top-quality grocery items for its members. However, their existing reliance on a paper-based system to manage member details and sales records has proven inefficient. This inefficiency hampers the store's ability to keep pace with customer demands, resulting in sluggish transaction processes and challenging audits.</p>

				<!-- Business Value Description -->
				<h3>Business Value</h3>
				<p>Business value is a critical factor when deciding whether the backlog items should be prioritised when implementing design and development in our system. The business value we have scaled is from 1 â€“ 10. The higher the value, the more critical the backlog item will bring success to our system.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="en1" class="discript">
				<!-- Development Description -->
				<h3>Development Effort</h3>
				<p>Development effort here refers to the amount of time, resources and skills needed to build and complete each specific backlog item. The development effort of each backlog item is scaled from 1 to 10. The higher the value of the backlog item, the more complex it is to get it to work, and this requires more time and effort for this backlog item.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="discript">
				<!-- Feature Dependency Descrption -->
				<h3>Feature dependency</h3>
				<p>Feature Dependencies refer to which backlog items should start and complete before the next backlog item can take place. Most of the backlog items we planned to implement in sprint 1 have no feature dependencies because they can be developed first. This will be put into place when we consider what backlog items should be in sprint 1 and sprint 2</p>
